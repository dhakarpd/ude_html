                When many travelers think of Israel, they picture its historic capital of Jerusalem. But for cosmopolitan charm, the Mediterranean-facing city of Tel Aviv is the place to go. TripAdvisor calls Tel Aviv a "youthful and modern metropolis" and highlights the city’s thriving arts community, beaches, clubs and bars. While you can certainly find history in Israel’s second-largest city (visit Jaffa, the oldest part of the metropolis), Tel Aviv is indeed thoroughly modern.
                <br>
                The city’s top sights can be found in the neighborhood of Neve Tzedek, where a maze of winding streets house the city's hottest theaters and museums. TripAdvisor user JorgeJar of the United Kingdom called it “a little gem at the heart of Tel Aviv.”
